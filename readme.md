This project implements a framework for multiplying matrices using UPMEM PIM - a commercially available processing-in-memory solution. It will provide all necessary primitives to execute and control the process of matrix multiplication on this device. Those are - providing the patterns for distributing the matrices, executing operations and gathering results.
